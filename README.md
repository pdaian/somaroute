Somaroute
~~~~~~~~~

Somaroute is a routing infrastructure for the emotional-contagion based
manipulation of Internet traffic on an infrastructure level, allowing
Internet infrastructure providers to manipulate the mood of users
on their service by changing their exposure to various content types
through psychological effects triggered by traffic delay.

The underlying mechanism and implementation of Somaroute is described
in the proof of concept whitepaper in this repository, `somaroute.pdf`.

A demo video, `somraoute.mp4` is also provided.

Additionally, the `tinyproxy` folder contains the source-code for the
Tinyproxy-based module we use for traffic manipulation of HTTP traffic.

See the README therein for compilation instructions, or the 
[OpenWRT cross compiling](http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/devel/crosscompile)
page for instructions for OpenWRT-based routers.
